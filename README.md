## AI Task Assistant

# Overview

The AI Task Assistant is a smart system that helps users manage, automate, and track tasks using the power of Generative AI.
It can understand natural language commands, break them into actionable steps, and provide intelligent suggestions to improve productivity.

The assistant is designed to:

Understand user intent through AI-driven parsing.

 Fetch and return correct task-related data.

Scale to handle multiple users and large task datasets.

Provide secure, efficient, and reliable endpoints for integration with frontend apps.

Project Idea

The goal is to create an AI-powered assistant that works like a productivity partner.
Users can add, update, delete, and query tasks naturally, while the backend ensures correctness and scalability.

Example use cases:

A user types: “Remind me to submit my project report by Friday 5 PM” → System converts it into a structured task with a deadline.

A team leader says: “Show me all pending tasks for my team” → System fetches filtered task data.

The assistant can also prioritize tasks or suggest an optimized schedule.
